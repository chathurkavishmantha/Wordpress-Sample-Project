How to commit to master branch our updated code(if we already created a branch).

15.First see your current branch status, using git branch
16.Then staying created new branch, make all changes and commit all changes.
17.Then using git checkout master command switch to the master branch.(you can see, when you go to the view folder and there are no changes, you have done so far to relevant file. Because master branch that relevent file is not update so far.)
18.Now you are in master branch. Now you can use git merge BranchName(your changed files related branch). Then we can see master branch file also updated.
